Zomato Customer Data Analysis - Finlatics Business Analyst Experience
Program
Project Overview
In this project, we aimed to understand customer preferences and dish trends among Zomato
users by utilizing data visualization techniques in Power BI. The goal was to create visual
representations that would provide actionable insights into customer behavior and
preferences, helping Zomato optimize their offerings and improve customer satisfaction.
Key Components of the Project:
1. Data Collection and Cleaning:
o Gathered customer data from Zomato, which included information on orders,
customer demographics, and feedback.
o Cleaned and pre-processed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. Data Visualization in Power BI:
o Developed interactive dashboards and reports to visualize key metrics such as:
▪ Popular dishes and cuisine trends.
▪ Customer demographics and their preferred dishes.
▪ Order frequency and time-based trends (e.g., peak order times).
▪ Customer feedback and satisfaction levels.
3. Insights and Analysis:
o Identified the top-performing dishes and cuisines based on customer orders
and feedback.
o Analyzed customer preferences across different demographics and
geographical locations.
o Highlighted trends in customer ordering behavior, such as seasonal variations
and peak times.
4. Recommendations:
o Provided actionable recommendations for Zomato to optimize their menu and
marketing strategies based on the visualized data.
o Suggested personalized marketing campaigns targeting specific customer
segments to increase engagement and satisfaction.
Sample Visualizations:
1. Top Dishes by Popularity:
o A bar chart showing the most ordered dishes across different regions.
2. Customer Demographics:
o A pie chart representing the age distribution of Zomato users.
3. Order Frequency Heatmap:
o A heatmap displaying the frequency of orders throughout the week.
4. Customer Feedback Analysis:
o A sentiment analysis chart showcasing customer feedback on various dishes.
Enhancements and Future Work:
1. Predictive Analytics:
o Implement machine learning models to predict future dish trends and customer
preferences based on historical data.
2. Segmentation Analysis:
o Further segment the customer base to identify niche markets and tailor
offerings accordingly.
3. Integration with Zomato's CRM:
o Integrate the Power BI dashboards with Zomato's Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) system to provide real-time insights and updates.
4. Advanced Visualizations:
o Use more advanced visualization techniques, such as geospatial analysis, to
understand regional preferences better.
5. User Interaction:
o Enhance the interactivity of dashboards to allow Zomato's marketing and
product teams to drill down into specific data points and customize their
views.
Conclusion
The Zomato Customer Data Analysis project provided valuable insights into customer
preferences and trends. By leveraging Power BI for data visualization, we created an intuitive
and interactive way to explore complex datasets. The actionable insights derived from this
project can help Zomato enhance their offerings, improve customer satisfaction, and drive
business growth.
